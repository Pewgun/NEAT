# NEAT

This is a python implementation of the NEAT algorithm(link = http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf).

Main.py contains code on how the algorithm can be used to solve the XOR problem. 
Also when executed it shows visual analysis of the learnining process as well as the final predictions for the problem.
