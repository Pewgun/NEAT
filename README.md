# NEAT

This is a python implementation of the NEAT algorithm(link = http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf).

Main.py contains code on how the algorithm can be used to solve the XOR problem. 

Also when executed it shows visual analysis of the learnining process:
1. the evolution of the species in the population
2. the graph of the fitness score of the best performing individual in each generation
3. the brain map of the best performing individual at the end of learning stage
4. the neural net of the best performing individual at the end of learning stage 

And finally it also indludes the final predictions for each training instance.

Other files contain the NEAT algorithm.
